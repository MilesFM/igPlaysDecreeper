# igPlaysDecreeper
A game to decreepy igPlays. It is a joke based on the community knowing a bit too much about the person behind [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/iwanPlays).

This game is programmed in pure JavaScript without the use of any game libraries. 

Only the game is licensed under MIT.

You can play the game [here](https://milesfm.github.io/igPlaysDecreeper).

Please do not take this seriously or as a doxxing threat.
